**Brief Description:** The 1000 Functional Connectomes Project is an initiative that aims to provide the broader imaging community complete access to a large-scale functional imaging dataset. It includes over 1200 resting state functional MRI (R-fMRI) datasets independently collected at 33 sites. All datasets have been generously donated by the principal investigators from the member sites.<br>
**Modality:** The primary modality of this dataset is resting state functional MRI (R-fMRI).<br>
**Data Availability:** The datasets are provided freely without assurance of quality or appropriateness for usage. In accordance with HIPAA guidelines, all datasets are anonymous, with no protected health information included. To access the datasets, individuals are required to register with the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project website on NITRC. Upon successful registration, users will have full access to the datasets, and the right to unrestricted usage of the datasets for non-commercial purposes
