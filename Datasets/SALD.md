**Brief Description:** The SALD aims to map the structural and functional changes the human brain undergoes throughout adulthood and to replicate previous findings. It comprises a large cross-sectional sample (n = 494; age range = 19-80) and is designed to help the scientific community understand the developmental trajectory of the human brain and the changes that occur as a function of aging.<br>

**Modality:** The dataset includes:<br>
One T1-Weighted MPRAGE anatomical scan<br>
One eight-minute resting state fMRI scan<br>
Basic phenotypic information (Age, sex, handedness) and qap measures for each subject<br>

**Data Availability:** Data for SALD are available for download in an Amazon Web Services S3 bucket in both uncompressed and compressed format, in the folders RawData_BIDS and RawData_tar, respectively. Each file can only be accessed using HTTP. You can obtain a URL for each desired file and then download it using an HTTP client such as a web browser, wget, or curl1. Each file can only be accessed using its literal name - wildcards (i.e. “*”) will not work
