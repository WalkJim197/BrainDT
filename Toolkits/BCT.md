**Brief Description**:The Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT) is a toolbox for complex-network analysis of structural and functional brain-connectivity data sets. It aims to characterize brain connectivity with neurobiologically meaningful statistics.

**Platform:** The BCT is primarily a MATLAB toolbox. However, there is also a Python version available.

**System:** As the BCT is a MATLAB toolbox, it should work on any system where MATLAB is installed, including Windows, Linux, and MacOS. The Python version should work on any system where Python, scipy, and numpy are installed
