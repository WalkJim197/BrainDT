**Brief Description:** The study focuses on understanding the biological mechanism of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) in preclinical Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and identifying those who will soon convert to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This is critical for developing appropriate strategies for early diagnosis and intervention of AD.<br>

**Modality:** The study involves extensive assessment, including clinical and neuropsychological assessments, blood sample collection for plasma beta-amyloid and ApoE genotype, urine samples collection for AD7c-NTP, and multimodal MRI scans. The MRI scans include structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, resting-state functional MRI, and optional task-based functional MRI. There are also optional glucose metabolism and amyloid positron emission tomography.<br>

**Data Availability:** Approximately 800 subjects with SCD who are between 50 and 79 years old will be recruited through standardized public advertisements or memory clinics. Subjects will be contacted by telephone every 3 months and interviewed, on average, every 15 months for 5 years. The study endpoint is the development of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. However, the specific details about the data availability are not mentioned in the search results. For more detailed information, you may need to contact the researchers directly or check the official website of the study.
