The SUDMEX_CONN dataset is a Mexican open dataset of patients with Cocaine Use Disorder (CUD) and matched healthy controls. Here are the details:<br>

**Brief Description:** This dataset includes demographic, cognitive, clinical, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The study was conducted at the National Institute of Psychiatry in Mexico City.<br>
**Modality:** The MRI data in this dataset includes:<br>
Structural (T1-weighted) sequences.<br>
Multishell high-angular resolution diffusion-weighted (DWI-HARDI) sequences.<br>
Functional (resting state fMRI) sequences.<br>
**Data Availability:** The repository contains unprocessed MRI data available in Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format with corresponding metadata available at the OpenNeuro data sharing platform. Researchers can pursue brain variability between these groups or use a single group for a larger population sample
