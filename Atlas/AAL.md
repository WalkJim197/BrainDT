**Brief Description:** The Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas is a digital atlas and software package of the human brain. It provides an automated anatomical parcellation of the spatially normalized single-subject high-resolution ‘T1’ volume provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). The AAL atlas has undergone several versions, each adding more detailed regions of interest<br>

**Regions:** The AAL atlas includes various regions of the brain, including both grey and white matter. Grey matter consists of neuronal cell bodies, neuropil (dendrites and unmyelinated axons), glial cells (astrocytes and oligodendrocytes), synapses, and capillaries. White matter, on the other hand, is composed mainly of myelinated axon tracts. The AAL atlas helps in the segmentation and study of these regions<br>

**Species:** The AAL atlas is primarily designed for use in humans.
