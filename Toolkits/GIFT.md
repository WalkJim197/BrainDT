**Brief Description:** GIFT (Group ICA of fMRI Toolbox) is a MATLAB toolbox that implements multiple algorithms for independent component analysis and blind source separation of group (and single subject) functional magnetic resonance imaging data. It is supported by the NIH under grant 1RO1EB000840 to Dr. Vince Calhoun and Dr. Tulay Adali. 

**Platform:** GIFT works on MATLAB R2008a and higher. 

**System Requirement:** It is not dependent on additional MATLAB toolboxes like Image Processing, Signal Processing, etc. The software can be run on both Windows and Linux systems
