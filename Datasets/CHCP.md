**Brief Description:** The Chinese Human Connectome Project (CHCP) aims to provide large sets of multimodal neuroimaging, behavioral and genetic data on the Chinese population that are comparable to the data of the HCP. The CHCP protocols were almost identical to those of the HCP, including the procedure for 3T MRI scanning, the data acquisition parameters, and the task paradigms for functional brain imaging. The CHCP also collected behavioral and genetic data that were compatible with the HCP dataset. The first public release of the CHCP dataset is in 2022<br>

**Modality:** CHCP dataset includes high-resolution structural MR images (T1W and T2W), resting-state fMRI (rfMRI), task fMRI (tfMRI), and high angular resolution diffusion MR images (dMRI) of the human brain as well as behavioral data based on Chinese population. <br>

**Data Availability:** The unprocessed "raw" images of CHCP dataset (about 1.85 TB) have been released on the platform and can be downloaded. Considering our current cloud-storage service, sharing full preprocessed images (up to 70 TB) requires further construction. We will be actively cooperating with researchers who contact us for academic request, offering case-by-case solution to access the preprocessed data in a timely manner, such as by mailing hard disks or a third-party trusted cloud-storage service.
