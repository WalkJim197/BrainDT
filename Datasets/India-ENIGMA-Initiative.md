**Brief Description:** This initiative aims to address the knowledge gap in dementia research by undertaking state-of-the-art research at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, India, in collaboration with the University of South California (USC), USA. The objective is to evaluate the influence of various biomarkers on brain aging. The study includes research participants such as healthy elders, persons with Alzheimer’s dementia, and persons with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI—a stage between normal cognitive functioning and dementia), who volunteer to participate in the research.<br>
**Modality:** The study looks at various biomarkers – genetic, hormonal, markers of cardiovascular risk, and brain imaging. The brain imaging measures are computed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<br>
**Data Availability:** The ENIGMA-INDIA program is funded by the National Institute of Aging (NIA)/ National Institute of Health (NIH), USA. The ultimate aim of the program is to create a data repository to predict brain age gap valid for the Indian cohort. However, the specific details about data availability are not mentioned on the website
