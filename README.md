## Introduction
1. :triangular_flag_on_post: The original intention of creating this repository is to integrate the ****latest existing**** neuroscience databases and toolkits, in order to meet the needs of researchers in the field of ****neuroscience****
2. :point_right: Due to my limited energy and time, there may be some data or toolkits that I have overlooked, so I appreciate your understanding. If you discover any information that has not been included, please contact me through the official account background, and thank you very much!

### Datasets

Name | Brief descriptions | Modality | Availability |
---- | ----- | -----  | ----- 
[Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)](https://www.oasis-brains.org) | OASIS is an initiative that provides open access to neuroimaging datasets related to brain health, focusing on ****healthy aging and Alzheimer’s disease**** research.OASIS comprises several datasets, including OASIS-1, OASIS-2, OASIS-3, and OASIS-4. These datasets have been utilized for hypothesis-driven data analyses, development of neuroanatomical atlases, and development of segmentation algorithms | sMRI,rs-fMRI,dMRI | Free
[The Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE I/II)](https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/) | ABIDE is a collection of functional and structural brain imaging data aimed at accelerating our understanding of the neural bases of ****autism****. It includes data from individuals with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The initiative has aggregated data collected from laboratories around the world and includes two large-scale collections: ABIDE I and ABIDE II. Each collection was created through the aggregation of datasets independently collected across more than 24 international brain imaging laboratories | rs-fMRI,sMRI | Free
[The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD)](https://abcdstudy.org) | The ABCD Study is a prospective longitudinal study that follows nearly 12,000 youth across the United States from the ages of 9-10 through early adulthood. It is the largest and most comprehensive longitudinal study on ****adolescent brain development****. The study includes a diverse sample of youth enrolled at 21 research sites across the country | sMRI,task-fMRI,rs-fMRI,dMRI | Free
[Human Connectome Project (HCP)](https://www.humanconnectome.org) | The HCP aims to map the ****healthy human**** connectome by collecting and freely distributing neuroimaging and behavioral data. The data includes diffusion and anatomical neuroimaging data, which are openly available to the scientific community for examination and exploration. These include brain image and results volumes obtained from the advanced Siemens 3T Connectome imaging system based at MGH, as well as data obtained using conventional imaging systems. | rs-fMRI,dMRI | Free
[The ADHD-200 Consortium](https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/adhd200/) | The ADHD-200 Sample is a grassroots initiative dedicated to accelerating the scientific community’s understanding of the neural basis of ADHD. This dataset is particularly significant because ****Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)**** affects at least 5-10% of school-age children and is associated with substantial lifelong impairment. |rs-fMRI,sMRI| Free
[Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA)](https://enigma.ini.usc.edu) | The ENIGMA project provides a centralized, and continuously updated, repository of meta-analytical case-control comparisons across ****a wide range of disorders****. The ENIGMA Toolbox is an open-source repository for accessing 100+ ENIGMA-derived statistical maps, visualizing cortical and subcortical surface data, and relating neuroimaging findings to micro- and macroscale brain organization. |various types of neuroimaging data| Free
[The Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study (AIBL)](https://aibl.org.au) | The AIBL study is a large-scale project aimed at understanding ****Alzheimer’s disease****. It gathers data on biomarkers, neuroimaging, cognition, mood, health, and more. The AIBL data set is available through the same technical infrastructure as the US-based Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and is referred to as AIBL (Australian ADNI) |MRI,PET | Apply
[Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease (MIRIAD)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/drc/research-clinical-trials/minimal-interval-resonance-imaging-alzheimers-disease-miriad) | The dataset includes scans of 46 ****Alzheimer’s sufferers**** and 23 healthy elderly people1. Many scans were collected of each participant at intervals from 2 weeks to 2 years1. The study was designed to investigate the feasibility of using MRI as an outcome measure for clinical trials of Alzheimer’s treatments1. It includes a total of 708 scans and should be of particular interest for work on longitudinal biomarkers and image analysis |MRI | Free
[SchizConnect](https://schizconnect.org/queries/new) | SchizConnect is a virtual database that allows users to search and download public neuroimaging data related to ****schizophrenia****. It integrates data from various heterogeneous databases, providing a single point of access for multi-site, multi-dimensional, and multi-modal data. |sMRI,fMRI,dMRI | Free
