Brief Description:
Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT12) is a software package designed to facilitate the analysis of medical images, particularly for neuroimaging studies. It is used for processing and analyzing structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. CAT12 provides a comprehensive set of tools for tasks such as image registration, segmentation, statistical analysis, and visualization.

Platform:
CAT12 is primarily designed to run on MATLAB, a high-level programming language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming.

System Compatibility:
It is compatible with multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. However, since it is a MATLAB-based toolbox, the specific system compatibility would depend on the version of MATLAB being used, as MATLAB itself supports these operating systems.
