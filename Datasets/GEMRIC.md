**Brief Description:** GEMRIC was founded with the belief that collaboration and mega-analysis of combined data will lead to new knowledge that can be generalized across individual research sites. The initiative aims to investigate the neural underpinnings of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) with the ultimate goal to develop markers predicting treatment response and derive mechanistic insights to develop new treatment options. The study includes clinical and MRI neuroimaging data before and after ECT.<br>
**Modality:** The primary modality of this dataset is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).<br>
**Data Availability:** GEMRIC data will only be shared with the collaborators in GEMRIC, and data will be stored on a secure server at the University of Bergen (UoB), Norway. Collaborators can upload, access and work with the data through a secure connection, provided by UoB. It is not allowed to download data from the server
