**Brief Description:** This dataset is a long-term test-retest sample of young healthy adults in Southwest China. It has been used to map the structure and function of the human brain, as well as its behavioral associations. The dataset includes brain and behavioral data across a long-term retest-duration within three and a half years.<br>

**Modality:** The SLIM dataset provides a set of structural, diffusion, and resting-state functional MRI images. Specifically, it includes:<br>
Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) Scan Protocol<br>
Magnetization-Prepared Rapid Acquisition with Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) Scan Protocol<br>
Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) Scan Protocol<br>

**Data Availability:** The dataset is available for non-commercial purposes. To gain access to the INDI datasets, individuals are required to register with the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project website on NITRC. Upon successful registration, users will have full access to the datasets.
