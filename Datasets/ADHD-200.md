**Description:** The ADHD-200 Sample is a grassroots initiative dedicated to accelerating the scientific communityâ€™s understanding of the neural basis of ADHD. It includes 776 resting-state fMRI and anatomical datasets aggregated across 8 independent imaging sites. Of these, 491 were obtained from typically developing individuals and 285 from children and adolescents with ADHD (ages: 7-21 years old). Accompanying phenotypic information includes diagnostic status, dimensional ADHD symptom measures, age, sex, intelligence quotient (IQ), and lifetime medication status.<br>

**Modality:** The ADHD-200 dataset includes resting state rs-fMRI images. These 947 datasets are composed of structural and resting state functional MRI data.<br>

**Data Availability:** The ADHD-200 Sample is openly sharing neuroimaging data. The unrestricted public release of the datasets is announced. The preprocessed results can be downloaded from NITRC and from an Amazon Web Services Public S3 Bucket
