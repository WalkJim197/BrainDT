**Brief Description:** OASIS comprises several datasets, including OASIS-1, OASIS-2, OASIS-3, and OASIS-4. These datasets have been utilized for hypothesis-driven data analyses, development of neuroanatomical atlases, and development of segmentation algorithms.<br>

OASIS-1 consists of a cross-sectional collection of 416 subjects aged 18 to 96. For each subject, 3 or 4 individual T1-weighted MRI scans obtained in single scan sessions are included.<br>
OASIS-2 consists of a longitudinal collection of 150 subjects aged 60 to 96. Each subject was scanned on two or more visits, separated by at least one year for a total of 373 imaging sessions.<br>
OASIS-3 is a longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging, clinical, cognitive, and biomarker dataset for normal aging and Alzheimerâ€™s Disease.<br>
OASIS-4 contains MR, clinical, cognitive, and biomarker data for individuals that presented with memory complaints.<br>
**Modality:** The primary modality used in the OASIS dataset is T1-weighted MRI scans.<br>

**Data Availability:** All data is available via www.oasis-brains.org. The OASIS datasets hosted by central.xnat.org provide the community with open access to a significant database of neuroimaging and processed imaging data across a broad demographic, cognitive, and genetic spectrum. All OASIS data use requires acceptance of the Data Use Agreement
