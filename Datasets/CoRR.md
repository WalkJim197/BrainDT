**Brief Description:** The goal of CoRR was to create an open science resource for the imaging community that facilitates the assessment of test-retest reliability and reproducibility for functional and structural connectomics. In order to accomplish this, CoRR has aggregated resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) and diffusion imaging data from laboratories around the world. The CoRR includes 33 datasets, of which 32 are currently available for download, consisting of: 1629 Subjects, 3357 Anatomical Scans, 5093 Resting Functional Scans, 1302 Diffusion Scans, and 300 CBF and ASL Scans.<br>
**Modality:** The primary modalities of this dataset are resting state functional MRI (R-fMRI) and diffusion imaging.<br>
**Data Availability:** The complete CoRR dataset is now available through the COINS neuroinformatics platform. To access CoRR data, individuals are required to register with the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project website on NITRC. Upon successful registration, users will have full access to the datasets, and the right to unrestricted usage of the datasets for non-commercial purposes
