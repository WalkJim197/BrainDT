**Brief Description:** FreeSurfer is a software suite for the analysis and visualization of structural and functional neuroimaging data from cross-sectional or longitudinal studies. It is developed by the Laboratory for Computational Neuroimaging at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging. FreeSurfer provides a full processing stream for structural MRI data, including: skull stripping, B1 bias field correction, gray-white matter segmentation, cortical surface reconstruction (gray-white matter boundary surface and pial surface), regional parcellation on the cortical surface, and subcortical brain structures.

**Platform:** FreeSurfer is not a package based on a specific programming language like Python or Matlab, but an independent software suite.

**System Requirements:** FreeSurfer can run on Linux (CentOS 7, 8, Ubuntu 18, 20, 22), Mac OS 10.15 or newer, Windows 10,11 (hosting Linux under WSL or VirtualBox). It requires an Intel processor that supports AVX instructions. For reconstruction, 8GB of RAM is recommended, and for viewing graphics, 16GB of RAM is suggested. The installation package size is about 16GB. The size to process a typical subject is about 300MB. In addition, Matlab is required to run FS-FAST, which is the fMRI analysis stream of FreeSurfer. If you plan to process multiple subjects simultaneously, your machine must have four cores and 16GB of memory. Lastly, FreeSurfer requires a 3D graphics card and accelerated OpenGL drivers.
