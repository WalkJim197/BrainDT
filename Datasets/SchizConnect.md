It integrates data from various heterogeneous databases, providing a single point of access for multi-site, multi-dimensional, and multi-modal data.<br>

**Modality:** The neuroimaging data available on SchizConnect spans various modalities. While the exact modalities available can vary between datasets, they often include structural MRI (sMRI), functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and others. Some datasets may also include task-based fMRI or resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data.<br>
