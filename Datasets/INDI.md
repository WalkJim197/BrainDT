**Brief Description:** INDI is a global initiative that aims to make neuroimaging datasets freely available to the research community1. The platform hosts a variety of datasets, including the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project, INDI-Prospective, INDI-Retrospective, Preprocessed Connectome Project, and others. Each collection is created through the aggregation of datasets independently collected across more than 24 international brain imaging laboratories.<br>
**Modality:** The modalities of the data hosted on INDI can vary depending on the specific dataset. However, it generally includes neuroimaging data types such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and others.<br>
**Data Availability:** To access the datasets, individuals are required to register with the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project website on NITRC. Upon successful registration, users will have full access to the datasets, and the right to unrestricted usage of the datasets for non-commercial purposes
