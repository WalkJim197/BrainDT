**Brief Description:** The ENIGMA project provides a centralized, and continuously updated, repository of meta-analytical case-control comparisons across a wide range of disorders. The ENIGMA Toolbox is an open-source repository for accessing 100+ ENIGMA-derived statistical maps, visualizing cortical and subcortical surface data, and relating neuroimaging findings to micro- and macroscale brain organization.

**Modality:** The ENIGMA dataset includes various types of neuroimaging data. Here are some examples:<br>
Subcortical Volume: Data from 12 subcortical regions, bilateral hippocampus, and bilateral ventricles.<br>
Cortical Thickness and Surface Area: Data from 34 cortical regions.<br>
Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI): Data from 21 major white matter tracts.<br>
Resting-State Functional MRI (rs-fMRI): Data from 7 resting-state networks.<br>
Task-Based fMRI: Data from various cognitive tasks.<br>
Electroencephalography (EEG): Data from various EEG experiments.<br>

**Data Availability:** The ENIGMA project is committed to open science. Most of the data is publicly available and can be accessed by researchers around the world. However, some datasets may require application and approval due to privacy and ethical considerations.
