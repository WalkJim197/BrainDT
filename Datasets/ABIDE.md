**Brief Description:** ABIDE is a collection of functional and structural brain imaging data aimed at accelerating our understanding of the neural bases of autism. It includes data from individuals with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The initiative has aggregated data collected from laboratories around the world and includes two large-scale collections: ABIDE I and ABIDE II. Each collection was created through the aggregation of datasets independently collected across more than 24 international brain imaging laboratories.<br>

**Modality:** The primary modality used in the ABIDE dataset is functional and structural brain imaging.<br>

**Data Availability:** The ABIDE dataset is publicly available through the COINS Data Exchange application. This web-based data sharing environment allows researchers to browse the extensive COINS database for data related to their research. Since the ABIDE dataset is public, it is pre-approved for sharing in the Data Exchange. This means that the ABIDE data will be made instantly available for download upon requesting it. To access ABIDE data, users need to register with the 1000 Functional Connectomes project at NITRC.org
