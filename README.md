## Introduction
1. :triangular_flag_on_post: The original intention of creating this repository is to integrate the ****latest existing**** neuroscience databases and toolkits, in order to meet the needs of researchers in the field of ****neuroscience****
2. :point_right: Due to my limited energy and time, there may be some data or toolkits that I have overlooked, so I appreciate your understanding. If you discover any information that has not been included, please contact me through the official account background, and thank you very much!
3. :sun_with_face: The dataset will be categorized based on different types of mental illnesses (such as depression, autism, schizophrenia, etc.), and the tools will be divided into different systems (such as Windows and Linux)
