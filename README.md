## Introduction
1. :triangular_flag_on_post: The original intention of creating this repository is to integrate the ****latest existing**** neuroscience databases and toolkits, in order to meet the needs of researchers in the field of ****neuroscience****
2. :point_right: Due to my limited energy and time, there may be some data or toolkits that I have overlooked, so I appreciate your understanding. If you discover any information that has not been included, please contact me through the official account background, and thank you very much!

### Datasets

Name | Brief descriptions | Modality | Availability |
---- | ----- | -----  | ----- 
[Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS)](https://www.oasis-brains.org)) | OASIS is an initiative that provides open access to neuroimaging datasets related to brain health, focusing on ****healthy aging and Alzheimer’s disease**** research.OASIS comprises several datasets, including OASIS-1, OASIS-2, OASIS-3, and OASIS-4. These datasets have been utilized for hypothesis-driven data analyses, development of neuroanatomical atlases, and development of segmentation algorithms | MRI | Free
[The Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE I/II)](https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/)) | ABIDE is a collection of functional and structural brain imaging data aimed at accelerating our understanding of the neural bases of ****autism****. It includes data from individuals with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The initiative has aggregated data collected from laboratories around the world and includes two large-scale collections: ABIDE I and ABIDE II. Each collection was created through the aggregation of datasets independently collected across more than 24 international brain imaging laboratories | MRI | Free
[The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD)](https://abcdstudy.org)) | The ABCD Study is a prospective longitudinal study that follows nearly 12,000 youth across the United States from the ages of 9-10 through early adulthood13. It is the largest and most comprehensive longitudinal study on adolescent brain development4. The study includes a diverse sample of youth enrolled at 21 research sites across the country | sMRI,task-fMRI,rs-fMRI,dMRI | Apply
